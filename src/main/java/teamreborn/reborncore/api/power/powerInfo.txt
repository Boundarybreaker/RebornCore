TechReborn v3 power spec:

TechReborn v3's power is based of a lot of ideas that factorio has provided, so thanks :)

All machines will be connected into a grid using cables, or each other. The grid will not store power, but will look for the amount of power advalible from all of the IGridProvider's. Next it will as
all th IGridReciever's how much power they would like. No power is stored in the grid or in machines. Only in power storage banks.



The power will then be split between the Reviever's based on how much they asked for. For example:

Generator A provided 25 watts of power.
Generator B also provided 25 watts of power.

The grid has a toal of 50 watts of power that must be used or detroyed.

Machine A wants to use 50 watts of power
Machine B and C also want to use 25 watts of power each.

All machines on the grid want 100 watts of power between them, but there is only 50.

Becuase machine A asked for 1/2 of required power (100) the power it will get 1/2 of the provided power (50).

Machine A gets 25 watts of power.
Machine B and C get 12.5 watts of power.

So all 50 watts of power was used.

Excess power will just be lost.


Power storage:

Power storage will be able to only take in exccess power, and will only provide extra power when there is a need.
